1, Milestone Project Description

2, Downloading and cleanning the data

```{r setup}
#Download the raw data
DataLink <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip"
if (!file.exists(basename(DataLink))){
  print("Downloading the data from the source website...")
  download.file(DataLink,basename(DataLink))
  unzip(basename(DataLink))
  print("Data downloaded")
}else{
  print("Data downloaded")
}

#Here, we are going to focus on the en_US dataset

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
